# SOC with Splunk ES

## About

This project covers three scenarios:

1. **Protecting:** This project uses Splunk and the log history provided by the networking team to create baselines to set Alerts, Automated Reports, and a Dashboard to detect suspicious activity at the Apache and Windows servers.

2. **Defending:**  Live attack. Using Splunk to identify targets, sources, and impact.

3. **Lesson learned:** Design mitigation strategies to protect servers from future attacks.

## The Narrative behind the project

VSI, a company that designs virtual reality programs for business, has heard rumors that a competitor may be launching cyberattacks against them. 

As SOC analysts, you are tasked to use Splunk to monitor potential attacks on your systems and applications. Your Networking team has provided past logs to help you develop baselines and create reports, alerts, and dashboards.

Later, VSI experienced several cyberattacks, likely from their adversary JobeCorp. Fortunately, your SOC team had set up several monitoring solutions to help VSI quickly identify what was attacked. These monitoring solutions will also help VSI create mitigation strategies to protect the organization. Now, you will need to design mitigation strategies to protect VSI from future attacks.

You are tasked with using your findings to suggest mitigation strategies
